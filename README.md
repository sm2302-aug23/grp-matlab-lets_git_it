### 1) Graph paper transcription

Initially, we did a rough sketch of our nicknames in cursive on a square plot. 
We selected only 9 letters in this task which are: a, b, f, i, l, q, s, y, z.

Additionally, we took note of the exact coordinates from the rough sketch to be plotted on the square plot.
Furthermore, each cursive letter starts and ends with the same y value which in this case is y = 2.5. 
This is to make sure when we plot our names, the word would be consistent and alligned.

We can observe this from the rough sketch of the graph plot below in figure 1 and figure 2:

From our rough sketch we can easily plot this in matlab, below is an example:
